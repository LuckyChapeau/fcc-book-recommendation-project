# fcc-book-recommendation-project

My solution to the freeCodeCamp project 'Book Recommendation Engine using KNN' (part of the 'Machine Learning with Python' course):

To be honest, I got a little help from the FCC community on this one: For archieving the right results, the data needs to be prepared in a certain way that - not only from my point of view - is not fully reasonable. Also there is a mistake in the data description as ratings in the actual data range from 0 to 10 and not just from 1 to 10. Finally, book recommendations need to be presented in reversed order in order to pass the test function, which is really weird...

Dear FCC team, please revise this project as soon as you find the time. Thanks!
